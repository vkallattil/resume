                    <p>
                        I’m a college student studying mathematics and a software developer
                        with substantial experience on the front end with React. I am also
                        proficient in Java and have some experience working on back-end APIs.
                        I am well-adapted to work environments with heavy learning curves and
                        I have excellent problem solving abilities.
                    </p>

                        including Firebase authentication and storage.
