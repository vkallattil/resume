# Vaishakh Kallattil's Live Resume

Here I'm hosting my working live resume document written in HTML and CSS: https://vkallattil.github.io/resume/

* As of 8/15/22 (date of my first commit) I'm planning to add bits of interactivity using React, I just need to figure my way around the build environment and how extensively it will be needed.

* As of 8/22/22 I've implemented some basic interactivity to collapse sections by clicking on their title span elements. Instead of using React I opted to use plain JavaScript to practice basic DOM manipulation and to maintain the original HTML content.
